# sg_campaignposters

A first trial with D3.js and Vue.js to make an interactive website on Singapore's national campaign posters. 

Let's hope this IRP thing works out. 

Okay list of files on this repo: 

1. All the data files are in .json type and are in the main folders
2. Images used are in `img` folder. I resized them for the website accordingly. 
3. CSS files are styling and I used Semantic UI for the base and changed it with main.css. 
4. JS files are for all the SVG scripts
5. Index.html is the main single page website file 

To run on local, make sure you have node.js installed 

cd to the correct folder. and `http-serve`
