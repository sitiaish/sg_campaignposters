Singapore is the ‘Campaign City’. In less than 55 years of independence, Singaporeans have seen a plethora of over 200 national campaigns (cite). This research project is an attempt to trace how Singapore’s society changed over the years in terms of state policies that manifest in national campaigns. According to Tham (1986), national campaigns, in the context of Singapore, are state initiated and inspired movements which have an organised and formal course of action, taken with the intent of arousing public awareness and influencing public behaviour (Tham, 1986).</p>

<p>Posters are more than just communication tools used in campaigns. To a a larger extent, posters are the product of national policies that aim to mitigate certain social issues in Singapore. As such, a longitudinal study of posters can refashion posters as sort of a barometer to distill the social landscapes of a particular time.</p>

<p>Each grid box here represents a campaign poster pertaining to either one of the following categories – health, environment and population control. These posters are courtesy of the National Archive of Singapore’s (NAS) digital database.</p>
